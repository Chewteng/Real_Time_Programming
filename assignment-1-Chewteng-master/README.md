## Introduction
This system is developed by using MAVEN and Java programming language. It stores each student data such as their matric number, name and github link in the Sqlite database with a certain format. There are a total of 29 students in the list. The main function of the system is to compare that data by retrieving the submission status data column stored in the database and generate result that is divided into two parts, which are the students' data who submitted and did not submit their GitHub accounts in a certain format respectively. Users are able to get the results by running the program file that is located in the src/main/java/my/uum/App.java folder.
