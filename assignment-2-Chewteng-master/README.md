üëâ Matric Number: 263117

üëâ Name: H'ng Chew Teng

üìö I am a student in the sixth semester and I am currently studying a bachelor's degree in Information Technology.

üòÑ I am from Johor and currently stay in my hometown.

## Introduction
<p align="justify">This assignment 2 is to develop a program with Telegram Bots by using MAVEN and Java programming language. First of all, scraping the data from three specific url link given and storing that data into the Sqlite database. The program will receive the input through Telegram Bots and return the corresponding results based on the choice of the user. There will be four choices in the system. The first function of the system is that it will able to receive an input of matric number through Telegram Bots and return the student's name, Github ID, Github link, Youtube channel name and the Youtube link from the Sqlite database back to the Telegram Bots when the user selects the /matricno option. Each matric number is executed using a thread. Besides, the system can also count the number of students in this real-time programming class and display out their details such as matric number and name when the /totalstudent option is chosen. Apart from that, the system will also count the number of students who have and have not submitted the Github account when the user clicks the /githubsubmission option. For the /githubsubmission option, the system will have one extra function which is /comparegithubsubmission option to display the list of student data who has and has not submitted the Github account with the correct matric number. This /githubsubmission option is the same function as the /youtubesubmission option.</p>
