## Question-2 (1 hour)

1. Write a Java program which has __THREE(3)__ threads.
   1. The first thread will calculate the average value of odd numbers between X and Y (excluding X and Y).
   1. The second thread will calculate the average value of even numbers between X and Y (excluding X and Y).
   1. The third thread will calculate the average value of prime numbers between X and Y (excluding X and Y). The result MUST be displayed after the first and second threads have completed. Use __CyclicBarrier__ to solve the problem. 

1. The values of X and Y  MUST be input from the keyboard. The program file and the class name which has the main method __MUST__ be named `MyCyclicBarrier.java` and place in the `src` folder.

1. Screenshot the result and upload to this repo too.

### Example of the output
```
Enter the X: 1
Enter the X: 12
Odd numbers: 3,5,7,9,11
Even numbers: 2,4,6,8,10
Prime numbers: 2,3,5,7,11

Average value of odd numbers: 7
Average value of even numbers: 6
Average value of prime numbers: 5.6
```
